\title{ensurer - ensure values are as expected at runtime}
\description{
ensurer is a small utility package for R which provides a simple
and light-weight mechanism for ensuring certain aspects of values at runtime.
}
\details{
R does not provide any mechanism for type-safety and since it is not
a compiled language, the risk of having unexpected results is there at
runtime. R functions often accept different types for the same input and/or
have different return types for different sitations.

As an example, a query to a database or the scraping of a website might
not return valid data, where "validity" can refer to a number of conditions.
It might a positive or certain number of records; that all cases are complete;
that some column is weekly increasing; or simply that the result is a
`data.frame`.

If one does not deal with these ambiguities and risks appropriately,
some resulting errors may be hard to track down. It is desirable to
get an error as soon as a value does not have the correct type or
does not satisfy certain criteria.

"Ensuring values" is here meant as a "contract", or a set of conditions,
such that if a value does not comply an error is raised instantly.
An ensuring contract (a function) is created with \code{\link{ensuring}}
(ideal for multiple use or readability with complex contracts).

It is also possible to ensure properties on the fly using
\code{\link{ensure_that}} (ideal for simple, one-time contracts).

Using the \code{magrittr} pipe \code{\%>\%} greatly improves semantics of the
functionality provided by this package, but it is not necessary.

This package is not meant as a substitute for unit testing, and great
packages for this already exist, e.g. \code{testthat} by Hadley Wickham.
The ensurer package is meant as a simple and ideal tool for scripts or
programs where runtime conditions may break the functionality, and
where errors should be raised as soon and clear as possible.
